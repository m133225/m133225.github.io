    <p>So let’s move on to rotations.</p>
<hr />

<p>There is a group of rotations, called Special Orthogonal group SO(n) where n is the dimension of the issue. This is also known as the <em>lie</em> group.</p>

<p>There are several representations for these group of rotations which we will be discussing later on.</p>

<p>The SO(3) group satisfies 4 axioms: closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. In addition, it is also considered a continuous group since the binary operator is a continuous operation. It is also a <em>smooth manifold</em>, which we will look into now.</p>

<p><strong>Manifolds</strong><br />
So what are <em>smooth manifolds</em>?<br />
First, let’s look at the ideas of <em>homeomorphism</em> and <em>diffeomorphism</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, <em>homeomorphism</em> is a function that maps one topological space to another, with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bijection</li>
  <li>f and f<sup>-1</sup> are both continuous</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Diffeomorphism</em>, on the other hand, is a function f, together with its inverse f<sup>-1</sup>,</p>

<ul>
  <li>has all partial derivatives, of all orders</li>
  <li>which all partial derivatives are continuous</li>
</ul>

<p>So, then, a <em>manifold</em> (of dimension n) is a set M which is homeomorphic to R<sup>n</sup>.
For it to be a <em>smooth manifold</em>, it should ALSO be <em>locally diffeomorphic</em> to R<sup>n</sup></p>

<p><strong>Euler Angles</strong></p>

<p>Another way to represent a rotation is through the use of <em>Euler angles</em>. Basically, any rotation in a 3D space can be represented as a combination of 3 rotations about linearly independent axes.
The rotation of the y-axis should be between 0 or pi, unless the axes are not linearly independent in the first place.</p>

<p>While Euler angles are easy to understand, they have duplicate ways of representing the same rotation.</p>

<p><strong>3D Rotation Matrices</strong><br />
The Euler’s Rotation Theorem<br />
- Displacement of rigid body such that one of its points remains fixed, is equivalent to a rotation</p>

<p>The proof is explained rather detailedly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>This theorem is essential in deriving the Rodrigue’s rotation formula, which helps us to combine the 3 axis-angle rotations without having to compute them explicitly (which is intensive).<br />
𝐑<sub>𝐮,𝜙</sub> = 𝐈cos𝜙 + 𝐮𝐮<sup>𝑇</sup>(1 − cos𝜙) +𝐮sin𝜙<br />
where u is the unit vector of the rotation axis, and 𝜙 is the angle rotated according to the right hand rule.</p>
