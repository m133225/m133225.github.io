In the uprising trend of Artificial Intelligence, automated agents have become one of the key focus.
Driverless cars, automated farming, and even AI in computer games are examples of such automated agents.

The key question lies:
How do these automated agents plan its motion in the midst of the ever-changing environment?

In order to do so, there is a need to understand the following:

1. How can the environment be modeled
	- needs to be efficient (real-time computation)
	- accuracy of its representation
	- dependent on actuators?
2. What search algorithms are used
	- needs to be efficient
	- completeness, optimality
3. What are the capabilities of existing technology
	- State-of-the-art algorithms in driverless cars, computer AI, etc

At the very end of this exploration, models/algorithms/techniques learnt will be used in a mini-project (some sort of game AI? :p).
